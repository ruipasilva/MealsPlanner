# MealPrep

### **Please note this is a work in progress**

The current API only allows 10 calls per minute.


## Introduction

This is my first app built in UIKit. I've focused on SwiftUI since the beginning but realised UIKit isn't going anywhere and is still crucial to iOS development.
This app allows you to add your own recipes, search online and save them to quickly access them in the bookmarks tab.

## My Goal

Learn UIKit and explore as much swift as I can using different ways of presenting and creating content such as views, viewControllers, buttons, labels, textfields, textviews, etc, etc. Even though it might look confusing (and it is), I wanted to use a mix of programmatic and storyboards.
